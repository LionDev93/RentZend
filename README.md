# RentZend

Hello, RentZend team.

I am glad to have a test.

-Front-End

  I used materialUI, Formik and Yup with using functional component and hooks.
 
-Back-End

  I used express framework for backend.
  
  mongoose for db and express-graphql for api.
  
-Test

 I used cypress framework.
 
 
***** 

I didn't implement the file upload part because (ofc no time) it is very simple and I have built many sites in a same way using grapql.

If we use graphql-upload npm, there will be no problem.

Thanks.
